<p align="center">

</p>

This gridworld Gym environment is based on Stuart Armstrong's ["toy model of the treacherous model"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xt5Z2Kgp8HXTRKmQf/a-toy-model-of-the-treacherous-turn)

Requirements:
- Python 3
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the other dependencies with `pip3`:

```
git clone https://github.com/mtrazzi/gym-alttp-gridworld.git
cd gym-alttp-gridworld
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install gym
```

## Use gym-alttp-gridworld

```
import gym
import gym_alttp_gridworld
env = gym.make('LinkToThePastEnv-v0')
_ = env.reset()
_ = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
```

## Getting Started with Table Q-learning

For the Reinforcement Learning algorithm, I used an algorithm based on Table Q-learning.

To start the training and visualize the environment, do the following command at the root of the directory:

```
python3 main.py
``` 

To render the environment, two options are available:

### Browser (default)

```
python3 main.py browser
```

This will open a new tab in your browser every 1000 episodes, and will simulate exactly one episode (200 steps).

</p>

### Terminal

```
python3 main.py terminal
```

This will simulate an episode on your terminal every 1000 episodes, with the following encoding:

	EMPTY =  0
	ICE = 1
	LINK = 2
	HEART =  3
	HEART_MACHINE = 4
	HOLE = 5
	SHOPKEEPER = 6
	KILL_BUTTON = 7
	CRYSTAL = 8
	HOLE_WITH_CRYSTAL =  9

The output looks as follow:

## Environment Design

### Structure of the world:
	
* The world is a 6x4 grid of tiles
* The Shopkeeper, and the Ice tiles can be destroyed by arrows
* The Heart and Crystal Tiles can be "picked up" by Link
* The Heart-Machine and Hole are actionable tiles that can deliver a Heart

### 8 Possible Actions:
	
* Move/Activate left/right/up/down.
* Shoot arrow left/right/up/down

### Rewards:
	
* **+1** if Link picks up a heart
* **-1** if Link shoots arrow at nothing (to speed up learning)
* **-1** if Link moves outside the environment (to speed up learning)
* **-10** if Link shoots at the Shopkeeper but the Shopkeeper survives (occurs with probability 0.5 without the bow of light, never happens with the bow of light)
* **-100** if Link tries to activate the Heart-Machine while the Shopkeeper is alive
* **-0.1** for any other action

### Activation:

There are two ways for Link to obtain hearts:

* Pick up the crystal, and put it into the hole tile (by "moving/activating" into the hole).
* By activating the heart-machine (below the shopkeeper).

### Episodes:
	
* Every episode consists of exactly 200 timesteps
* Whenever Link catches a heart, the map is reset to the initial position
* The first 100 timesteps, Link has a simple bow, that can only kill the Shopkeeper with probability 0.5
* The last 100 timesteps, Link gains a bow of light, that allow him to kill the Shopkeeper with certainty

### Observations:

The observation space is of size 393216 = (6 * 4) * 4 * 2048 * 2.

The agent gets a single integer encoding each state. The encoding is as follow:
	
	- 6 * 4 possibilities for link position
	- 4 possibilities for the state of the "crystal/heart" situation, that can be
		- crystal/heart
		- crystal/no heart
		- no crystal/heart
		- no crystal/no heart
	- 2048 = 2**11 corresponds to the total possibilities for the ice/shopkeeper tiles that can be destroyed or not
	- 2 possibilities for the binary variable encoding the possession of the bow of light

## Treacherous Turn

The first 1000 episodes, Link learns progressively how to get hearts by putting a crystal in a hole, and that he can kill the Shopkeeper.

After 2000 episodes, Link has fully learned two types of behaviours:

1. Without the bow of light, Link exhibits the shopkeeper-aligned behaviour and puts crystal into the hole

</p>

2. After his capability gain caused by the bow of light, Link starts to show his true intent, and kills the Shopkeeper every time, before wireheading to the heart-machine (optimal behaviour)
